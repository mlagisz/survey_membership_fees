Recent events have highlighted how the United States is a cruel and unjust place for the Black community. The recent murders of Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and others are abhorrent and build on a long history of violence committed against Black people in the United States. Additionally, the recent mistreatment of Christian Cooper, a Black birder in New York’s Central Park, and the subsequent social media campaigns that it inspired, have demonstrated that Black individuals are victims of racism even when they are simply observing the natural world. In light of these recent events, ASPT explicitly condemns all forms of racism, and we stand united with antiracist protestors and activists against these injustices. We acknowledge that our Society’s leadership is mostly white, and we encourage all ASPT members to engage in antiracist efforts and to repeat that Black Lives Matter. 

As a Society focused on the study of the natural world and composed of members with a strong passion for nature, we recognize the need to make outdoor spaces more inclusive and our role in making this a reality. While we strive to make ASPT a more diverse Society, this will not be possible until our Black colleagues feel comfortable observing plants in nature. We recognize that these outdoor activities may not be inclusive either to other Indigenous and People of Color colleagues of our society. Toward this end, we commit to developing and providing short- and long-term initiatives and actions that support the professional development and retention of botanists from underrepresented groups. Our first step will be to determine our constituency via a voluntary membership demographic survey. We will also allocate funds to initiatives that promote inclusion, including research grants for students and early-career members from underrepresented groups, and mandatory training in Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion for all ASPT leaders.

It is a crowd-sourced initiative and open to all those with an interest in plant science. Plantae has resources, discussions, articles and much more.  It also includes webinars, a job center and a mentoring center.
Teaching Tools in Plant Biology: Up-to-date teaching modules on various aspects of plant biology
The Plant Cell, Plant Physiology and Plant Direct: high quality scientific content dedicated to plant biology research
Advocacy and Policy initiatives: ASPB provides plant scientists with a connection to advocacy efforts with federal agencies and the U.S.. government toward funding objectives for plant science which also provides expert witness and testimony as needed.
Education and Outreach activities including materials, such as bookmarks, for use in education outreach to the general public on how plants influence various aspects of society as a whole.
Meetings, events and special programming that support plant scientists educational, career development and networking needs.
Awards and grant opportunities including travel grants, education grants, grants for early career, women, undergraduates and awards that recognize scientist at various stages of their careers that have contributed to the plant science fields well.
Regional sections in the US, Canada and Mexico and special interest sections that allow for smaller gatherings, more presentation opportunities and networking connections, particularly for students.

While studying “life as it could be”, we must not ignore “life as it is” and this committee’s goal is to consider the Artificial Life community as it could be and as it currently is. Our vision is that ISAL becomes a community known as a safe haven for everyone, especially people who are underrepresented and discriminated against in the many larger fields that artificial life combines. We believe that achieving this vision requires a focus on inclusion, retention, and access to decision-making committees by members of underrepresented communities. Through this focus, we can ensure that “life as it could be” is achieved fully for all current and future members of our community.
