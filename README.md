Title   
Priced out of belonging? Insufficient concessions on membership fees across international societies in ecology and evolution     

Abstract   
Learned societies, as professional bodies for scientists, are an integral part of the scientific system. However, their membership fees have the potential to be prohibitive to the most vulnerable members of the scientific community. To shed light on how membership fees are structured, we conducted a survey of 182 international learned societies relevant to researchers in ecology and evolution. We found that 83% of these societies offered fee concessions to students, but only 26% to postdoctoral researchers. An average regular membership fee was $67.8 USD, student fee – $27.4 USD (42.7% of the regular fee), and postdoctoral fee – $42.7 USD (52.9%). Other types of individual concessions, such as for emeritus, family, or unemployed, were rare (2–20%). Of the surveyed societies, 43% had discounts for members from developing countries (Global South). Such discounts were more common among societies located in high-income countries. Societies with a publicly visible commitment to equity, diversity, and inclusion, were more likely to offer different types of concessions. Currently, fees may prevent researchers from vulnerable and underprivileged groups from accessing multiple professional benefits offered by learned societies in ecology and evolution. We recommend tangible actions towards making learned societies more affordable and accessible.
